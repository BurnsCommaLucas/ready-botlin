A WoW inspired ready-check bot for [Discord](https://discord.com) servers. This bot is a near-identical replacement of 
the [classic bot](https://github.com/BurnsCommaLucas/ready-bot) with some 
[new features](#what-new-features-does-this-bot-have).

[ready-bot support server](https://discord.gg/uwkF27Gt9M).

## Usage

Once you add the bot to your server, start a ready check for a number of users with:

```
/check count:<number>
```
or check for specific users with
```
/check mentions:<mention> <mention> ...
```
and have users ready-up with 
```
/ready
```
Full usage can be found by typing 
```
/help
```
Ready checks can be overridden by invoking the `/check` command again, and checks will only be performed if the `count` 
or number of `mentions` (of non-bot members) entered is greater than 0. The person who initiates the ready check may 
also respond to the check as ready.

If you experience any unusual behavior from the bot or think of a feature that could be added, please open an issue on 
GitHub.

## FAQ

### This bot isn't really "new" is it?
No, the bot isn't "new" as far as Discord is concerned, but previously ready-bot was built from the old 
[javascript code](https://github.com/BurnsCommaLucas/ready-bot) and in April 2023 I replaced it with the version built 
from this new Kotlin code. The new version serves the same purpose as the original but with the added benefit that I 
will have a better understanding of how to fix things should they break. 

### What new features does this bot have?

#### Persistent checks!
In the old bot, everything related to a check was stored in memory within the bot. This meant when the bot 
restarted all checks were destroyed (ðŸ˜¥). The migration to this new bot adds database functionality so that no longer 
happens! This was also a good future-proofing step in case the bot grows large enough that I need to have several 
instances of it running simultaneously.

#### Role mentions! 
As part of the upgrade, I'm excited to say I added the ability to mention custom roles in a `mentions` check. I won't be 
adding the `@here` or `@everyone` tags just yet since they require additional permissions for the bot to use, and those 
mentions are something I'd like to put behind in-server permissions so that folks can disable the tags to prevent 
abuse.

### What updates are you still planning?

#### Permissions! 
In the future, I'd like to allow more control for server admins over how the bot operates in each server. Adding a 
persistent database is the first step toward this goal. I'll also need to assess how best to implement the permissions 
to avoid making my database storage run rampant.

### Why did you rewrite the bot in Kotlin?
Discord has added really excellent features for bots like slash commands and ephemeral messages, and I was able to add 
those to the final update of the old bot. Unfortunately, adding those features to my already brittle Javascript code 
pushed it past its limit and â€“ due to my level of comfort with Javascript â€“ I've been unable to properly diagnose and 
fix the issues that have cropped up.

Switching to Kotlin lets me make use of the experience I have from my day job; I can use tools I'm comfortable with, 
try out design patterns I see at work, and test new libraries or systems I might want to bring back to my job later.
Plus since this project is still just a one-person-enterprise, it behooves me to make it as easy for myself as possible 
to keep things from being a slog.
